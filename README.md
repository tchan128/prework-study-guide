# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation of this project is to incorporate everything that has been learned during the pre-work and make a study guide to document these learnings. I build this project to not only learn the fundamentals of coding but also to provide a space for me I can refer to look at whenever I want to. This project acts as a solution where I am able to place all my new learnings into a consolidated area. Not only that but it is a place for me to look back into if I want to quickly review how certain basics work. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I learned how they all work together to create a project and a final product. Along the way, I also learned how they interact with each other and the functions and commands I have to call.

## Usage

In the project, each section contains simple notes for certain topics that were covered during the pre-work. These topcs include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. When you open the DevTools console, you will be able to see and test the JavaScript running. This will enable you to not only understand how it interacts with the project but also allow for certain debugging purposes. The JavaScript that is running will display topics we have learned and choose one topic for us to study first.
